# Decomp project for "Hot Wheels Turbo Racing"
> *So WIP it hurts*

Splitting help is extremely appreciated!

Currently working on USA version, so your ROM must be named `baserom.us.z64` and placed in the root of this repo.


# Building

**Clone the repo**
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:CrashOveride95/hotwheelsturbo.git
```

**Extract ROM**
```
make extract
```

**Compile**
```
make --jobs
```

Upon successful compilation you should be greeted with:
```
build/hotwheelsturbo.us.z64: OK
```
